# BouncingShapes

The setup of ImGUI and SFML was done with the help of ["ImGui + SFML Tutorial - Install & Basics" by Victor Gordan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YS5WJTeKpI&t=53s).

I added movement and bouncing of the circle.

The library folder (lib and include folders) are not included in this repository.

GUI under development.

Assuming that (in the config file) every shape is within the bounds of the window.
