# BouncingShapes

The setup of ImGUI and SFML was done with the help of ["ImGui + SFML Tutorial - Install & Basics" by Victor Gordan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YS5WJTeKpI&t=53s).

I added movement and bouncing of the circle.

The library folder (lib and include folders) are not included in this repository.

GUI under development.

Looking for suggestion: How should a shape behave if it is spawned outside the border of the window? For the time being, the shape just vibrates.
